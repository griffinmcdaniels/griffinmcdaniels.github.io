# personal academic website for Griffin McDaniels
<https://griffinmcdaniels.github.io>

This is my personal academic website, hosted by github pages. It comprises html and css, with one javascript for the image slideshow on the "About" page. I aimed for a simple and clean look with minimal animations.

To use this webpage as a template, just fork and edit away. However, please note that I built this site from the bottom up and am not a front-end developer. I am sure there are mistakes and faux pas abound. You can use this to jump-start your own academic webpage, but I would not necessarily come here for css tips and tricks!
